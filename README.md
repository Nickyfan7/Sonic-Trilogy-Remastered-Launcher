Here you can read up on info for the Games such as their Release Dates,Plots, Prototypes, Cheat Codes, and Interviews.
You can also view Promotional Artwork, the Games Manuals, and Unused Content.

=== Controller Support ===
You'll be able to use Xbox Controllers, PS4 Controllers, and Custom Controllers! (Although for those you'll need to set them up.)
this way you get to feel like you're playing on console with a menu to select the games from.

===Console/Mobile Support==
I plan to eventually bring these launchers to Console (Whatever console you can play all three on), and mobile if possible that way you can select the games get info on them, 
launch the protos and more in style!


There are some other plans in store i'm not so sure about implementing but potential plans include:
-Ability to Launch Prototypes, from their respective screen, given you provide it.
-Compatability with the originals (Possible, but not likely.)
